Phrase Hunter - word guessing game
For this project I am going for the exceeds expectaions grade.

I found this to be a particularly difficult project because of the interconnectivity of the files and the classes within but I got there in the end.

This is a hangman style word guessing game in which the player is presented with a series of blank letter tiles and must select letters from the keyboard buttons below the tiles to try and reveal the phrase.

The player has 5 lives and if they guess a letter that is not in the phrase then they are out of lives and the game over screen will display. They are then given the option to play again.

If the player reveals all of the letters in the phrase then the game over screen will display showing they have won and again prompt to play again.

For the exceeds grade I have added the ability for the player to use keys on their own keyboard as well as being able to select the buttons on screen to choose letters.

I have also changed the color the keys turn on screen depending on if they were correct or incorrect guesses.

If the player makes a correct guess the button on screen briefly enlarges and then shrinks back down.

When the player makes an incorrect guess the button enlarges but also rotates 360 degrees to indicate an incorrect attempt.

I have changed the background to a photo I took in Peru and added a box shadows as the tiles were difficult to see against the background image.
